# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Discord Sound Effect Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord bot that plays sound effects in a voice channel.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

When a chat command is used, the bot will play a sound effect in a specific voice channel. The bot will have several sound effects to choose from, each with a different chat command. For example, a bruh sound effect would be /b. The bot would have a command to join call and a command to leave call, and would automatically leave the call if nobody else is present after a certain amount of time.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

n/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

build a discord bot that does something in response to a user command.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

build a discord bot that plays some kind of audio in a voice channel.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

build a discord bot that has several commands and options of audios to play.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research discord bots and the mechanics of building and implementing them. I'll need to find out how to incorporate audio and voice channels into the code. I'll also need to figure out how I can share this with my friends and upload it to servers I am in.
